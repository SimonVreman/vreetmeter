# Vreetmeter 🍽️
An experimental project, my first ever app and first ever Swift project. But I ended up using this on a daily basis, so now I am stuck developing it :,). It integrates with HealthKit and the API from Voedingcentrum to give insight into your diet. I have no plans to publish this to the AppStore, it is a learning project and intended for personal use only.
